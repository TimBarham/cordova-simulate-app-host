A browser based plugin simulation tool to aid development and testing of Cordova applications.

*Note that this is currently a work in progress / prototype! It still lacks a bunch of functionality, and may be quite buggy.*

It is somewhat based on [Apache Ripple&trade;](http://ripple.incubator.apache.org/), but aims to improve it in the following ways:

1. Separates the simulation UI from the app (to improve the debugging experience, and allow for using modern browser developer tools). This also protects the UI from a misbehaving app.
2. Allows plugins to define their own simulation UI.

# Installation

```
npm install -g cordova-simulate
```


# Usage
From the command line anywhere within a Cordova project, enter the following:

```
simulate [<platform>] [--target=<browser>] 
```

Where:

* **platform** is any Cordova platform that has been added to your project. If no platform is specified, the `browser`
  platform will be used.
* **browser** is the name of the browser to launch your app in. Can be any of the following: `chrome`, `chromium`, `edge`,
  `firefox`, `ie`, `opera`, `safari`.  

# What it does

Cordova simulate will launch your app in the browser, and open a second browser window displaying UI that allows you to control how plugins in your application work.

This preview version currently includes built-in support for the following Cordova plugins:

* [cordova-plugin-camera](https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-camera)
* [cordova-plugin-device](https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-device)
* [cordova-plugin-device-motion](https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-device-motion)
* [cordova-plugin-dialogs](https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-dialogs)
* [cordova-plugin-geolocation](https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-geolocation)
* [cordova-plugin-globalization](https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-globalization)
* [cordova-plugin-media](https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-media)
* [cordova-plugin-vibration](https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-vibration)

It also allows for plugins to define their own UI. To add simulation support to a plugin, follow these steps:

1. Clone the `cordova-simulate` git repository (`git clone https://github.com/TimBarham/cordova-simulate.git`), as it contains useful example code (see `src/plugins`).
2. Add your plugin UI code to your plugin in `src/simulation`. Follow the file naming conventions seen in the built-in plugins.
